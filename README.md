# CIA-Scraping

## Task 1: Who's Got Beef?  
The CIA has a running tab on international boundary disputes: https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/disputes-international.  Which countries seem to be involved in the most land disputes?

## Task 2: Tipping Culture
The CIA also publishes information about 262 countries: https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/. Use the page's API to randomly select 20 countries and report on the tipping cultures in those countries. You can find that information in the Travel Facts page for each country.

## Task 3: Population Centers 

You will use the following link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/centers-population.html
From this link, you will be able to find two distinct links: Centers of Population by State for 2010 and 2020. Once you have those links, access the information on those pages, and plot the populations centers with the information you have. Are there any differences that seem compelling to you?
